My name is Victor. Hi. And you are... You are Frank. You are so much more than just a sheep, aren't you? Oh, yeah? How would you know? Look at you. You're an adventurer, Frank. Just like me, you're a lone wolf. Tell me, does one choose to be alone? No, one doesn't. One doesn't even choose to be a wolf. Or does one?
